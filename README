CTorrent 
=======
CTorrent is a BitTorrent Client program written in C/C++ for FreeBSD and Linux.
Fast and small are CTorrent`s two strengths.

original ctorrent has a -e option means:
-e int          Exit while seed <int> hours later (default 72 hours)
this ctorrent_min modified -e option which now means:
-e int          Exit while seed <int> minutes later (default 5 minutes)

fine grain to control seed time
